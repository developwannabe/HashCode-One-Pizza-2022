# HashCode-One-Pizza-2022
 Possible solution to HashCode 2022 "One Pizza" with 2732 score
 <br> Please, contact me if you can improve the code!
 First of all, we need to read the inputs (a_an_example, b_basic...) and take the data we think it's useful, so we can short it in a proper way. <br>
In this case, I used ArrayList, because this class has a lot of method that are very useful to solve this problem (it's like a normal Array). <br>
I take all the ingredients and sort them by a ratio (if liked +1, if disliked -1). <br>
Then I made the pizzas adding the most valorated ingredients 1 by one, like this: <br>
Ingredient with 78 rate, 76, 70... <br>
And asking each client if they like the pizza, in that case, the pizza get +1. <br>
Finally, I choose the most liked pizza. <br>
Hope this helps. <br>
